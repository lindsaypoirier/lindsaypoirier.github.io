Hello! My name is Lindsay Poirier, and I'm a cultural anthropologist of data advocacy, governance, and infrastructure. I'm also an Assistant Professor of Statistical and Data Sciences at Smith College. My research critically examines the social contexts underpinning how public interest datasets (such as datasets documenting social and environmental injustices in the U.S.) take on their form and meaning. I engage both cultural analysis and exploratory data analysis in my work and draw from scholarship in critical data studies, information studies, the digital humanities and data science. I teach courses at Smith College that investigate data injustices and the social contexts of data production, along with courses that introduce data science concepts and methods.
